If you lose, you lose hitpoints. (You cannot gain back lost hitpoints.)\n\nYour object is to defeat all the monsters and free the land from their mayhem.\n\nIf you are lucky, you may find some objects along the way to help you in your quest!\n\nThe HELP button may be useful if you have any questions.");
