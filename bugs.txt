- if you try to reroll after invalid, it accepts instead
- if you run through an entire game then click new game and start another one, it hasn't reset the stats from the first one so it glitches out and rolls two monsters right after one another, and finishes the second game
- when fighting a monster, if you try to choose an option after an invalid entry, it just closes the dialogue box with nothing having happened
- the monster's stats don't appear until after you have fought it

GOALS:
- move the parts of main.js into a true MVC file system. How to call them as needed? How to split it up?
- bugfixing -- does this have to do with asynchronicity?
